My own ideas for the assignmnent:
* Try to implement darkmode with button.   | Note:
* Rolling ball on top of the menu,         | Note:
    or in margin when scrolling down?


Scripting ideas to implement?
* Some kind of function with CSS animation connected to it?
* Function; if window width less than x change the font-size and table sized down? First letter only, small ICONS instead?
* Being able to change between bright & dark theme with button (bright currently standard for the website).

My own ideas implemented and completed in the website thus far:
* Added extra support regarding screen sizes.
* Error message that the website does not support less then 120px in width!
