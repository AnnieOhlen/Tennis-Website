# Tennis-Website
A school assignment, using JavaScript and HTML, to create a booking site for a fictional tennis club.

## Neccesary pages for a passing grade:
* Portal/start page
* Courts
* Changing rooms
* Sauna
* Booking system (implemented a simple form)

### Specifics:
* Responsive bookingsystem
* Validate in-data with JavaScript and DOM
* Useage of dynamical menus
* Use of a modern JavaScript-libary such as React
* Good accessibility (see WCAG)
* Implement sessionStorage

### Extra implementations suggested:
* Calendar (not implemented)

### My own ideas implemented:
* Added extra support regarding screen sizes.
* Error message that the website does not support less than 120px in width!
* Dark theme switch but with a few issues:
    * Button needs to be clicked twice
    * Not all the color variables are correctly switching
    * Not true dark theme
