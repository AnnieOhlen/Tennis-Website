Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
 Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
 The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
 The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

<br><br>Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport.
